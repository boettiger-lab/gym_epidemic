# examples_sir

Herein are some files to interact with the `gym_sir` environment. In `stable_baselines3/`, I have scripts to create the plots and results from "One-Shot Epidemic Control with Soft Actor Critic". In `tuning/`, one can perform a round of hyperparameter tuning on the different algorithms used in stable baselines 3.
